# N-Break — Econet-over-WiFi (AUN) Bridge

## Overview

N-Break is an Econet-over-WiFi interface that allows a retro BBC Micro to
communicate with an AUN fileserver (or other device) over a modern IP network.

It recreates the classic Econet experience using inexpensive, readily
available hardware - no custom PCBs or extensive soldering required.

## Hardware Requirements

To build the interface, you will need:

- **1 × ESP32-C6 module**

  Approx. price: €5.39

- **2 × RS422/RS485 transceiver modules**
  Example: <a href="https://it.aliexpress.com/item/32688467460.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://it.aliexpress.com/item/32688467460.html</a>
  Approx. price: €1.69 each

- **1 × 5-pin DIN plug** and twisted-pair cable (e.g., CAT5)

- **Jumper/Dupont wires** to connect everything

- **3 resistors** for Econet termination and biasing:
  - 1 × **110 Ω** termination
  - 2 × **550 Ω** idle bias

## Hardware Assembly

Connect the components as shown in the schematic:

## Firmware Installation

Firmware is built and flashed using **idf.py** with the ESP-IDF toolchain.

1. Install ESP-IDF:

2. Build and flash the firmware:

   ```shell
   idf.py flash
   ```

## Device Configuration and monitoring

After flashing, the device will start a Wi-Fi access point named nbreak-econet.

1. Connect to the access point.

2. Open a browser and go to http://192.168.4.1

## AUN Fileserver Setup

You can use aund as your Econet fileserver:

Example configuration files are included in the contrib/ directory.

## Enjoy!
